# ðŸš€ 100_Days_Of_Coding-(Next_Level)


---


# ðŸš€ Day 1 - [9-5-2025]

## âœ… What I Did
- Solved 1 DSA problem on Leetcode and submitted successfully.
- Watched a Class 11 Mathematics lecture on the **Sets** chapter.

## ðŸ”§ Tools / Topics Covered
- Leetcode (DSA Problem Solving)
- Class 11 Sets (Math Foundations for ML)

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- Refined my problem-solving logic with hands-on coding.
- Understood basic set theory (unions, intersections, subsets), essential for deeper math topics.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- A solid start to the next 100 days.
- Consistency > Quantity. Will aim for at least 1 problem a day and small math progress.
