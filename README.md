# 🚀 100_Days_Of_Coding-(Next_Level)


---


# 🚀 Day 1 - [9-5-2025]

## ✅ What I Did
- Solved 1 DSA problem on Leetcode and submitted successfully.
- Watched a Class 11 Mathematics lecture on the **Sets** chapter.

## 🔧 Tools / Topics Covered
- Leetcode (DSA Problem Solving)
- Class 11 Sets (Math Foundations for ML)

## 📘 What I Learned
- Refined my problem-solving logic with hands-on coding.
- Understood basic set theory (unions, intersections, subsets), essential for deeper math topics.

## 🧠 Reflection
- A solid start to the next 100 days.
- Consistency > Quantity. Will aim for at least 1 problem a day and small math progress.

# 🚀 Day 2 - [10-5-2025]

## ✅ What I Did
- Solved **1 easy Leetcode problem** focused on **Arrays**.
- Practiced problems from the **Sets** chapter in Class 11 Math.
- Created a GitHub repo 📁 named **Cheatcheet** and added cheatsheets for:
  - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-learn.
- Posted on **LinkedIn** about **Agentic AI**, contributing to public learning and visibility.

## 🔧 Tools / Topics Covered
- Leetcode (Arrays)
- Class 11 Mathematics: Sets
- Python Libraries Cheatsheet Creation
- AI Concept: Agentic AI
- GitHub & LinkedIn for personal branding

## 📘 What I Learned
- Strengthened understanding of array manipulation in DSA.
- Practiced core set operations (Union, Intersection, etc.)
- Explored AI concepts like **Agentic AI** — a step forward toward becoming an AI engineer.
- Realized the importance of knowledge documentation (cheatsheets) and community sharing.

## 🌱 Growth Reflection
- Publishing on LinkedIn and pushing to GitHub means you’re **not just learning — you're building a brand.**
- Today had learning, creation, and communication — a perfect triangle for growth.
