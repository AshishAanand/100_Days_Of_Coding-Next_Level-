# 🚀 100_Days_Of_Coding-(Next_Level)


---


# 🚀 Day 1 - [9-5-2025]

## ✅ What I Did
- Solved 1 DSA problem on Leetcode and submitted successfully.
- Watched a Class 11 Mathematics lecture on the **Sets** chapter.

## 🔧 Tools / Topics Covered
- Leetcode (DSA Problem Solving)
- Class 11 Sets (Math Foundations for ML)

## 📘 What I Learned
- Refined my problem-solving logic with hands-on coding.
- Understood basic set theory (unions, intersections, subsets), essential for deeper math topics.

## 🧠 Reflection
- A solid start to the next 100 days.
- Consistency > Quantity. Will aim for at least 1 problem a day and small math progress.

# 🚀 Day 3 - [11-5-2025]

## ✅ What I Did
- Solved **1 easy Leetcode problem** (Arrays).
- Explored **Polynomial problems** in Class 11 Math (instead of Sets — smart topic switch).
- Created a new markdown file in my **Cheatcheet repo**:
  - `MachineLearning_Terminologies.md` with 10 core ML terms simplified.
- Posted on **LinkedIn** for engagement (ML learning discussion).

## 🔧 Tools / Topics Covered
- Leetcode (Arrays)
- Class 9 Mathematics: Polynomials
- Machine Learning: Bias, Variance, Overfitting, Model, Algorithm, etc.

# 🚀 Day 4 - [12-5-2025]

## ✅ What I Did
- 🧠 Practiced **Matplotlib** instead of DSA:
  - Explored different plot types (line, bar, histogram, scatter).
  - Learned styling and customization for better data visuals.
- 📚 Studied **Graphs of Polynomials (Degree 2 & 3)**:
  - Watched a visual explanation and solved 5 graph-based problems.
- 🤖 Updated `Cheatcheet` repo with:
  - `ML_Workflow_Simplified.md`: Included the ML pipeline from data collection to deployment.
- 💡 Bonus: Brainstormed **3 AI product ideas**:
  1. Homework Doubt Solver for Students  
  2. Smart Grocery Reminder System  
  3. Auto Email Summarizer for Professionals

## 🔧 Tools / Topics Covered
- Matplotlib (Python Data Visualization)
- Polynomial Graphs (Math Class 10)
- Machine Learning Workflow (Project Planning)
- Ideation (AI-based product concepts)

## 📘 What I Learned
- Visualizing data with Matplotlib is crucial for interpreting ML models.
- Polynomial graphs help build intuition for real-world curve-based data.
- ML isn't magic — it’s a **structured pipeline** from messy data to useful predictions.

# 🚀 Day 5 - [13-5-2025]

## ✅ What I Did
- ✅ Solved **1 easy Leetcode problem** using the **Two Pointers** approach.
- 📊 Practiced **Graphs of Polynomials** (Class 11 Math):
  - Continued graph interpretation and curve analysis.
  - Strengthened intuition for how coefficients affect graph shape.


## 🔧 Tools / Topics Covered
- Leetcode (Two Pointers Pattern)
- Class 11 Math – Polynomial Graphs (Degree 2 & 3)


## 📘 What I Learned
- Graphs reveal how algebra transforms visually — useful in ML too.
- Two Pointers help solve many optimal subarray problems efficiently.
- Matplotlib skills are improving — more control = better storytelling with data.
